## A 3D Chess game (just like any others chess game) Three.js, can play with another players

### Overview
This simple 3D chess game is made for a 3D Programming courses, which is a university project. It uses the Three.js framework (and also Threex.DomEvents) to run a 3D environment on a HTML file. It mostlyy coded and programmed in JS, Models are free stuffs I download somewhere from https://free3d.com/ with .blend. The game is multiplayer and you have to click-click (no drags function used) the chess pieces mannualy
### Bugs
The game ends when a player captures the opponent's king.
### Installtion
You can pull or manually download this project into your computer. Next step, you can copy the whole project folder and throw it in the "htdocs" folder of "Xampp" (or any local host server applications). Finally, you need to start the the vitrual server and start the "chess.html" file to play
Thanks for reading this! This is 24 hours rush of me to research for algorithms and learn again the whole 3D world to finish this project. 
#ENJOY!
